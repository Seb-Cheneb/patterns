# 🐉 Godot Design Patterns: The Grand Spellbook of Game Architecture 🧙‍♂️

Welcome, brave dev-adventurer, to the **Grand Spellbook of Godot Design Patterns** — a whimsical repository of arcane programming rituals designed to help you conjure clean, maintainable, and _magically extensible_ games in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). ✨

This isn’t just code. It’s a **grimoire** of tested patterns, enchanted with comments, and wrapped in wizard robes of best practices. Enter if you dare (or if you're just tired of spaghetti GDScript 🧵🍝).

## 📜 What is this?

This repository is a curated collection of **design patterns** implemented using **Godot (GDScript)**. Whether you're summoning a Singleton, commanding a Command, or observing an Observer — this tome has you covered.

Each pattern is lovingly hand-crafted, explained, and demonstrated with a practical use-case, so you don't just learn _what_ it is — you learn _how to cast it_ in your game!
